# Stochastic Number Generator using Verilog

A Stochastic Number Generator (SNG) designed using Verilog, aimed at exploring approximate computing techniques. SNGs offer the advantage of reduced hardware demands at the expense of heightened latency and computational imprecision.

## Overview

This project showcases the design and implementation of a Stochastic Number Generator (SNG) using Verilog. The primary objective is to create an efficient stochastic number generator that leverages the benefits of approximate computing.

## Project Details

- *Project Coordinator:* Shyamali Mitra (Associate Prof., Dept of IEE)

## Features
